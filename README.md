This file is purely a Duplicate of the web pages already existing on Google search. I have created a look alike of the web page. This project is developed using Basic HTML and CSS code. However, the source code of the web page is developed on Flexbox. I have used basic styling to position the content.

This project is picked up from FreeCodeAcademy. You can find the source page link at the bottom of my recreated web page.

At each commit stage, I have added the tags and explained how I have codded to get the end result. I'll make sure to write down all the details at each revision of the code.
